PRE
Defining scope
-What kind of threats can we define to scan for
-Are we doing this for a controlled environment or general OS, meaning are we basing this off a predefined directory with access restrictions or certain minimum security criteria or any general access footprinting

POST
2 SERVER OS
3 DEPARTMENTS
2 DIFFERENT CLIENTS
NETWORK SEGMENTATION
Include different PCs for clients, workers etc.
Segmented in 3 layers
Production, Administrative, Financial
Separate environments
Basic security measures like 2FA, SSO, maybe Azure AD involvement
Guest internet breakout/network Wi-fi
"secure/redundant" internet for the whole company
1 department in a different physical location
NO CLOUD SHIT/No cloud authentication, so all on-premises AD/
Hosted/exposed linux machine with a program running, say a minecraft server lol
Focus on all 5 layers of security
Switch specific security
Have backup running without cloud
Point specific access monitoring
Could have a DMZ 
Auth/MFA
-Think about how you would make the "custom" dashboard/logging combo, as if they're too close in function, it could lead to easier compromise of the entire system
Why not have a security camera, cloudflare tunnel into the netlab
