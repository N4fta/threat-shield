Dear Sir or Madam,

We are a group of cybersecurity students from Fontys ICT in Eindhoven, seeking a company to collaborate with for a penetration test as part of our academic program this semester.

We would like to offer your company the opportunity to benefit from a controlled and ethical penetration test, conducted in alignment with your companyâ€™s policies. Our assessment aims to identify potential vulnerabilities and provide a detailed report with recommendations to enhance your security.

If this is of interest to your organization, we would be happy to discuss the details and define a scope that aligns with your needs. Please let us know a convenient time for a brief discussion.

Looking forward to your response.
