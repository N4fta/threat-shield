Dear Sir or Madam,

We are a group of cybersecurity students from Fontys ICT in Eindhoven, currently looking for a company to collaborate with for a penetration test as part of our academic program this semester.

We would like to offer your company the opportunity to benefit from a controlled and ethical penetration test, conducted in accordance with your companyâ€™s policies. Our assessment aims to identify potential vulnerabilities and provide a detailed report with recommendations for mitigation.

If this is of interest to your organization, we would be happy to discuss the details and define a scope that aligns with your needs. Please let us know a convenient time for a brief discussion.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

The Hackers Team
